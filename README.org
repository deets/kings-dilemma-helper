** TTS Notes

 - images are imported with 50px corresponding to 1 unit.
 - the top of the image shows in negative Z-direction
 - the game considers 1 unit to be 5cm. So 10 pixel represent 1cm.
 - z-axis is blue, x is red, y green.
 - the coordinate-system is left-handed
 - rotation is counter-clockwise in the direction of the axis
 - when importing the standard cube from blender that is 2m^3, 1m translates to 1 unit in TTS
